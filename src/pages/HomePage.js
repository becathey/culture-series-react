    <h1>The Culture Series</h1>
    <p>
      The Culture series consists of 9 novels and 1 book of short fiction
      featuring a fictional interstellar post-scarcity civilization created by
      the Scottish writer Iain M. Banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Culture is composed primarily of sentient humanoid aliens,
      artificially intelligent sentient machines, and a small number of other
      sentient "alien" life forms. Machine intelligences range from
      human-equivalent drones to hyper-intelligent Minds. Artificial
      intelligences with capabilities measured as a fraction of human
      intelligence also perform a variety of tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the series' protagonists are humanoids who choose to work for the
      Culture's elite diplomatic or espionage organizations, and interact with
      other civilizations whose citizens hold wildly different ideologies,
      morals, and technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the Culture's citizens do not live on planets but in artificial
      habitats such as orbitals and ships, the largest of which are home to
      billions of individuals. The Culture's citizens have been genetically
      enhanced to live for centuries and have modified mental control over their
      physiology, including the ability to introduce a variety of psychoactive
      drugs into their systems, change biological sex, or switch off pain at
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Culture holds peace and individual freedom as core values, and a
      central theme of the series is ethical struggles it faces when interacting
      with other societies.
